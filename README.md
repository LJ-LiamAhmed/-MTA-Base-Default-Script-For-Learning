It is made for learning purposes and to help new developers start building their own server from scratch.

## About

This project is an edited version of the default MTA scripts.  
I created it to learn step by step and also to give beginners a simple base to work with.

### Added Features
- Basic **database example** (simple queries to understand connection and usage)  
- **Login system** (for learning authentication)  
- Extra small code examples for practice  
- Removed the default loading screen *(not included, as I use it in another project)*
